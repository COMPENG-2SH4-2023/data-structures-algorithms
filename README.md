# Data Structures And Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms using JavaScript

-----------

## Big O Shorthands
- Arithmatic operations are constant.
- Variable assignment is constant.
- Accessing elements in array (by index) or object (by key) is constant.
- In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside the loop.

-----------

## Auxiliary Space Complexity
- Refers to space required by the algorithm, not including space required by the inputs.
- Most primitive (`boolean, numbers, undefined, null`) are constant space.
- Strings require `O(n)` space where `n` is the string length.
- Reference types are generally `O(n)`, when `n` is the length (for arrays) or the number of `keys` (for objects).

-----------

## Logarithmic Time/Space Complexity
- The logarithm of a number roughly measures the `number of times we can divide that number by 2` **`before we get a value that is less than or equals to 1`**.
- `Recursion` sometimes involve logarithmic `Space Complexity`.
